Blankspace is a LARP by Fractured Reality. Recently I was fortunate enough to play their most recent English-language run, and I had a great time. The game dealt with a lot of heavy topics, telling a story about personal struggle and growth in a retro sci-fi setting filled with surrealism and metaphor.
