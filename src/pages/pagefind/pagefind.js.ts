				'Living / Surviving Sep 20, 2019 – Filed under: musings Earlier this month, I lost my job. I’m not going to go into what happened, but it’s been a very eye-opening experience. I’ve normally left companies entirely of my own volition before, and that wasn’t the case this time. But I’m not really here to talk about that, I want to explore some of my thoughts around the idea of living and surviving, and the conflicts those two can have. This post is going to be a bit disjointed, as I’m currently sorting my own thinking around that. To clarify, when I say surviving, I mean doing what you need to continue to exist in this world. Food, shelter, clothing. Money. Perhaps it can even encompass luxuries; there’s certainly an argument as to what “you” means in the context of existing, though I’m not going to discuss existentialism and class issues today. When I say living, I mean purpose. Meaning. Finding something that makes you, if not happy or content, wanting to move forward. To wake up every day and continue your life. I’m sure most folks would think of faith here, but this could also include ideology, community, family, ambition, etcetera. Now, it’s not typically that simple a divide. I myself battle with depression constantly, so many days there’s not a reason for waking up except momentum. And for some, the two are the same thing. To survive is to live, to meet the day. Perhaps they feel the need to move forward out of defiance, or to prove something. What happens when what you need to do to survive comes into conflict with what you believe? How do you rectify that? For context, the place I’m coming from is based in ideological differences with capitalism despite having to survive under that system. I’ve also had a background in trying to live under a faith that I opposed. How do you reconcile that? And what do you do? My baseline is surviving. I realize that may not be everyone’s, but at the end of the day it’s important to ask: does the world need a martyr? What then? It’s certainly easy to intellectually rectify the issue, but where do you take action? How do you change things, or at least try enough to satisfy your needs? If you can’t change the world, what can you do to change your world? I don’t know. But I’m trying to take this time to figure out.',

				"Books n' Things Mar 13, 2019 – Filed under: books queerness transness So I’ve mentioned a lot in the way of books. I actually have started reading a lot since I came out as queer, looking to discover more of my new heritage and history. I haven’t really come up with any major discoveries or anything, though I’ve found some really good thoughts. I’ve explored areas touching on my own identity quite a bit. I think I’d like to grow my knowledge for identities adjacent to mine, such as queerness + non-whiteness, or the history of the gay community. Or maybe European queer history? So much of my information is US-centric, and I’d like to learn a bit more outside of the big ones like Hirschfeld. But in the meantime, here’s a few things I’ve read and my thoughts around them. Note I’ve linked to Goodreads as I’m not comfortable linking to Amazon or B&N. Many of these are available in your local library, so I’d recommend stopping there as well. Transgender Non-Fiction. #Trans - An anthology of modern trans voices, with a focus on how technology, social media, and YouTube has helped them discover their identities. A really good book, and has some interesting stories. Also let me discover the trans YouTube network, which is awesome. Gender Outlaw: On Men, Women and the Rest of Us - Kate Bornstein is great. This book covers a lot of the fundamentals of what being trans means from a rather irreverent standpoint, but honestly I like things that take themselves less seriously anyway. Gender Outlaws: The Next Generation - An anthology edited by Bornstein, with modern trans voices. Some really interesting things in there. Definitely recommend for some 201 reading. Transgender History - A very broad view on the history of trans folks in America and bits of Europe in the past 100 years or so. I liked it quite a lot, and definitely useful for an overview of the politics involved. Whipping Girl - Julia Serano’s classic work. It’s a bit hyperfocused on defending transwomen, but really good at dealing with that lack of knowledge. Trans Bodies, Trans Selves - A giant textbook covering many aspects of being transgender, from medical issues, politics, history, sex, dating, and a lot more. It’s really helpful, but also somewhat overwhelming. I’d recommend using it more as a reference than reading cover to cover. Femme / Lesbian History. Femme: Feminists, Lesbians, and Bad Girls - Great anthology that is all about addressing the stereotypes of the femme, from being tools of the patriarchy, to “not really lesbians”, to the good girls men want. Has a fairly historical view too, which I appreciate. Doesn’t deal with trans issues at all though. Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme - Very queer anthology about the different approaches to what it means to be a butch, femme, and somewhere in between. Very intersectional and has a lot of non-binary and trans voices. Super recommend. Fiction. Paul Takes the Form of a Mortal Girl - A wild tale about a trans shapeshifter named Paul and his story of excess across America. Super queer. Note it’s not in print anymore, but you can totally get it from the library if you’re an NYC local. Fierce Femmes and Notorious Liars - A really fun coming of age story from a deeply unreliable narrator, it takes the ordinary struggles of what it means to be a trans woman and turns it into a magical modern fantasy, almost. Freshwater - A really intense story about a Nigerian woman, Ada, and their life as someone with a foot in two worlds. Has some really interesting mythology, and uses some really wonderful metaphors to try and convey the non-binary experience. Has some dark themes though, so CW for self harm and sexual assault, among other things. Stone Butch Blues - This book made me cry multiple times. It’s a very sad and sometimes dark story, but also deeply powerful. Seriously, if you can take the content I’d super recommend it. Others. Femme in Public - Book of poetry by Alok Vaid-Menon, a non-binary femme based in NYC. Some deeply powerful poems about what it means to defy social norms. Arcane Perfection - An anthology on queer witchcraft. Some very useful things in there, including spells for warding off your deadname and ways to channel dysphoria. If you’re at all mystical and queer, I’d recommend looking it up. Girl Sex 101 - Reading this now, but so far having very good impressions. It’s an illustrated guide to having sapphic sex, and takes a fairly intersectional approach, covering all sorts of equipment, disabilities, and body types. I’d recommend this for bi or straight women too, as it provides great guides to consent and how to navigate your own body.",

				'Reflections on the Dreaming May 5, 2019 – Filed under: musings This past weekend I travelled to Atlantic City to experience Changeling: Waking Dreams. The event is based on Changeling: the Dreaming by White Wolf, a game about fae beings trying to survive, trapped in human hosts in the mundane world. A confession: I’ve never played nor even read Dreaming. I’ve heard friends say many good things over the years, but I’ve had many issues with legacy White Wolf. Also, I already am deeply in love with Changeling: the Lost, a game about PTSD, survival, and identity. Still, playing a grand scale Changeling event sounded amazing, and I know the designers in the form of Books and Świstak would treat me well. It didn’t hurt the game came off as deeply queer, an assumption that proved to be quite accurate. I’m going to give some of my thoughts on the design, setting, and the overall experience. What I’m not doing is talking extensively about my character. I strongly feel that attempts to convey the journey within liminal spaces like this inevitably fall short. I would encourage those who are curious about these sorts of experiences to try it out yourself! Setting & Design. The general premise of the event was essentially a giant party, where changelings can meet up in numbers, let their hair down, talk about things, dance, flirt, and be their gloriously absurd selves away from the mundanity of day to day living. The host of the event was the Prince of Glam and the Burning Revel, an all-changeling rock band that was well known in the community to throw a damn good party. This premise really spoke to me on multiple levels. Partying hard in the face of being erased from existence, gathering of an outsider community to be themselves, and reveling in absurdity and outrageousness. These themes are ones I care about deeply. The event started properly on Thursday around 3pm. One of the things I found interesting is we were going to have about 24 hours of out of character workshops, tie building, and general community building before we dove in. This highlights one of the biggest differences I had compared to other equivalent experiences: it didn’t feel rushed. Many a time I’ve had the feeling like we were rushing into play, with only an hour or two to prepare. This was very different in that regard. Another element that was different was the community building. It was clear the event was built with the expectation that you did not need to spend time and energy building connections with people before the event. A huge emphasis was put on building relationships with other players and characters. One of the first things the organizers had us do was put our characters aside and form “pods”, little groups of people that you didn’t know that was to be your out of character support group for the weekend. They often asked us to meet up with our pod and discuss how we’re feeling, what we’re nervous about, what is exciting, etc. I found this fascinating. One of the biggest issues with big expensive weekend events like this is that it’s often going in blind, especially for newer people. You don’t know anyone, you paid a lot of money and travelled and you are really nervous. I’ve had this feeling often, especially for international events where I have to deal with travelling far out of my country and have to deal with language and cultural barriers. What all this networking did was very helpful in providing points of connection both for the characters, but also the players. Not all of my ties worked out, but I was given so much opportunity to meet people and connect that once things started rolling I felt comfortable and supported by so many people. So that was a good start. The other thing I really appreciated is that while the event was based on Changeling the Dreaming, it also very explicitly was not tied to that canon. One of the dangerous things about making an event based on an existing property is that people may feel the need to call out any perceived deviations from that canon. However, the organizers very clearly stated that they operated by their own rules, and that we as participants decided what was real and what wasn’t. That was immensely helpful for people like me who didn’t know what rules written in the 90s said, nor honestly cared. A good moment where that popped up was the Kith workshops. I played a Selkie, which I understood to be a fae water creature of some sort, dangerous and glamourous. When I started talking to other Selkie players I learned there was a thing about pelts and seals. I had zero idea about that, and decided I was a siren creature and my “pelt” was my leather collar. Everyone thought that was cool and it was a non-issue. Overall I really appreciated the workshops. They let me really sink into who my character was, what they stood for, and how the fit into a marginalized community of fae once we entered play. The Experience. The event was bookended by concerts, which was very fitting with the theme. We started off with a show by Byrne Bridges blasting out in the concert hall. The band was pretty good, and I appreciated the genderfuckery involved. The concert venue from the stage. Let me take a moment and appreciate the venue. We were lodged in the Showboat Hotel in Atlantic City. It is a gorgeous space of moldering grandeur from the heyday of the city, now long gone. The spaces were giant and mostly empty, and we pretty much had free reign on the entire floor. The Foundation room was the primary space we operated in. It was formerly a club that was eclectically decorated and shut down around 2014 from what I can tell. The space was decorated somewhat by organizers and participants, but it stood very well on it’s own as the main location for this event. Once we entered play, I quickly fell into the vibe. Things kept on feeling unhurried, with no real set events you had to attend. It really did feel like festivals I’ve attended, where time ceased to have meaning and you simply gravitated in and out of orbit of various interesting people as you saw fit. Queer Goth Unseelie Night DJ Booth. For myself, I socialized for hours, familiarizing myself with my character and those around me. I quickly found those I gelled with, and spent a lot of time hanging out and enjoying their company. I got food at some point, but the highlight of the first night was very clearly Unseelie Goth night. As my character was a goth DJ, I’d been listening to some darkwave quite a lot, so I knew quite a few of those bands and it was fun to be my little goth character in their element. I actually confessed to the “real” goths afterwards that I haven’t had experience with that before and they were shocked! Throughout the weekend I got food when I wanted, napped when I was tired, stayed up late, and slept in till about noon on Saturday. It was lovely not having anything being fixed, and fit so well with the idea of a community finding a space to be themselves together and let their hair down. I also really appreciated the power of some of the roleplay I saw. Some folks really brought some intense feelings, and I meshed really well with many folks. People were also very safe, being incredibly good about negotiation and boundaries. I found myself ending in several romantic entanglements, crying at least twice, screaming about injustice quite a lot, and being brave enough to read poetry before an audience. The second day was filled with a feeling of farewell. I know this feeling all too well, having experienced it as an event winds down and people must face going back into the world. In the event world, characters had to decide whether they’d stay in this world, or leave the community they’ve built in the margins for someplace else. It was heart wrenching to see people leave, either forging their own paths in the world or leaving for Arcadia forever. There were so many goodbyes, and so many groups trying to find themselves after having holes torn in their collective souls. For myself, I decided that I was going to have my character stay in this world, but whether I’d leave this community or leave to forge my own left me uncertain. In the end I felt welcome enough to stay, though for how long I don’t know. The experience ended with a concert by the Burning Revel, played by The Manimals. We danced, those that stayed and those that left, and said our goodbyes to both our friends and our characters. When the last song ended, we were ourselves again. Overall, the experience was moving and wonderful in ways I didn’t expect. I enjoy many communities, and in some ways this felt like a mashup of all of them with a dusting of fairy on top. I really enjoyed portraying my goth femme rebel. Tempest, I will miss you, and I hope your anger will drive me to make the world a bit better. Farewell.',

We were lodged in the Showboat Hotel in Atlantic City. It is a gorgeous space of moldering grandeur from the heyday of the city, now long gone. The spaces were giant and mostly empty, and we pretty much had free reign on the entire floor. The Foundation room was the primary space we operated in. It was formerly a club that was eclectically decorated and shut down around 2014 from what I can tell. The space was decorated somewhat by organizers and participants, but it stood very well on it’s own as the main location for this event. Once we entered play, I quickly fell into the vibe. Things kept on feeling unhurried, with no real set events you had to attend. It really did feel like festivals I’ve attended, where time ceased to have meaning and you simply gravitated in and out of orbit of various interesting people as you saw fit. Queer Goth Unseelie Night DJ Booth. For myself, I socialized for hours, familiarizing myself with my character and those around me. I quickly found those I gelled with, and spent a lot of time hanging out and enjoying their company. I got food at some point, but the highlight of the first night was very clearly Unseelie Goth night. As my character was a goth DJ, I’d been listening to some darkwave quite a lot, so I knew quite a few of those bands and it was fun to be my little goth character in their element. I actually confessed to the “real” goths afterwards that I haven’t had experience with that before and they were shocked! Throughout the weekend I got food when I wanted, napped when I was tired, stayed up late, and slept in till about noon on Saturday. It was lovely not having anything being fixed, and fit so well with the idea of a community finding a space to be themselves together and let their hair down. I also really appreciated the power of some of the roleplay I saw. Some folks really brought some intense feelings, and I meshed really well with many folks. People were also very safe, being incredibly good about negotiation and boundaries. I found myself ending in several romantic entanglements, crying at least twice, screaming about injustice quite a lot, and being brave enough to read poetry before an audience. The second day was filled with a feeling of farewell. I know this feeling all too well, having experienced it as an event winds down and people must face going back into the world. In the event world, characters had to decide whether they’d stay in this world, or leave the community they’ve built in the margins for someplace else. It was heart wrenching to see people leave, either forging their own paths in the world or leaving for Arcadia forever. There were so many goodbyes, and so many groups trying to find themselves after having holes torn in their collective souls. For myself, I decided that I was going to have my character stay in this world, but whether I’d leave this community or leave to forge my own left me uncertain. In the end I felt welcome enough to stay, though for how long I don’t know. The experience ended with a concert by the Burning Revel, played by The Manimals. We danced, those that stayed and those that left, and said our goodbyes to both our friends and our characters. When the last song ended, we were ourselves again. Overall, the experience was moving and wonderful in ways I didn’t expect. I enjoy many communities, and in some ways this felt like a mashup of all of them with a dusting of fairy on top. I really enjoyed portraying my goth femme rebel. Tempest, I will miss you, and I hope your anger will drive me to make the world a bit better. Farewell.',
